    Dear *|FIRST_NAME|*, As we approach the new year, Lavender Turtle has been
    looking at its challenges and growth over the past year and we are looking
    ahead with enthusiasm to 2023. We're always trying to figure out ways to
    make our work more efficient, effective, and sustainable, both for our
    clients and our staff members, and the end of the year is a great time to
    regroup and refine our processes. In order to support our staff and to see
    the business thrive, Lavender Turtle will be increasing its 2023 rates
    across the board. Although these rate increases are significant, in reality,
    they bring us to a more competitive price point with comparable agencies.
    Most importantly and simplyâ€”as inflation affects all of us, it is necessary
    to make these changes in order to support our team members and to see our
    work sustainably growing into the future. From one business owner to
    another, I encourage you to increase your prices, as well, if possible, to
    avoid losing any margin. Our Services and 2023 Pricing Breakdown: Optimize -
    (Development support charged hourly) $100 per hour with a minimum 5-hour
    retainer. Hours good for 30 days. Maintain - (Lavender Care One Maintenance)
    $899 per month; includes 10 hours of support with no rollover, as well as
    the many perks of our maintenance plans. Grow - $299 SEO Audit; $1199+ per
    month for SEO campaigns. Scale - White Label - 20% discount on all services
    (max of 2 sites per plan). Hosting Only - $25 per month Questions? Please
    don't hesitate to reach out to me directly:
